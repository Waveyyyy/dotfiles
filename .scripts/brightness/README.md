# Brightness.sh

This script does what it says on the tin, fucks with system brightness, specifically for my current laptop.

&nbsp;

## Switches

1. inc

Yet again does exactly as titled, increments the brightness based off the previous brightness value

2. set

Another beautifully self descriptive switch, simply sets the brightness value to the one provided

3. help

Provides a lovely help message that i spent longer on than writing the actual script :)

&nbsp;

## Usage

To use this script without needing an absolute path each time, it should be moved into the `/usr/local/bin` directory and be executable `chmod +x ./brightness.sh`
