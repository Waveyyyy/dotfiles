#### Been messing with p10k will update this readme when i get the chance

Been spending a bunch of time on my laptop messing with config files recently, have only ever used bash previous to this month so decided i'd have a crack at the config file for zsh.

Not much additional content in here as of, mainly plugins and theme stuff.

&nbsp;

1. Theme is a custom gruvbox dark theme
    * Only custom thing is that ive changed the context part (username@hostname) to be Wavess[ocean wave emoji]

&nbsp;

2. Plugins!
    * git
    * zsh-autosuggestions
    * zsh-syntax-highlighting
    * colored-man-pages
    * gitignore
    * autojump

&nbsp;

3. Changed language from en_US.UTF-8 to en_UK.UTF-8

&nbsp;

4. History misc.
    * Disallow commands that start with spaces from being logged in history
    * Change number of history lines to 5000
    * Change number of lines of history kept / session to 5000

&nbsp;

5. alias' 
    * `alias emacs="emacs -nw"`
    * `alias -g xclip="xclip -selection clipboard`
        * bcos typing this command each time i use xclip is annoying
